For Akindo AI crypto hackathon. Hello, it's okimochi token
This is my first trial of coding.
I know there are a lot of mistakes and should be corrected.
But I'm glad if you see these code and give a comment to me.

This project is for phisical stores which are registered in google maps.
I know there are many stores which are loved by their fans but we can't see how much they are loved in phisical world.
You might think the stores want to be famous or to expand to other areas, but most of them don't think like that, cuz they want to protect the vibe which is loved by fans.
So I'd like to make an service where we can see their value by tipping online and I'd like fans to get insentives of being fans.
